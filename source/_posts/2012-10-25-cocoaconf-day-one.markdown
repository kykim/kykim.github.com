(James Dempsey)[http://jamesdempsey.net] is an old colleague from (Apple)[http://apple.com] back in the day. He's recently left the mothership for wonders of (independent software development)[http://tapas-software.net]. I didn't really, need to take the class, but I felt that it would be nice to attend his Introduction to iOS session at (CocoaConf)[http://cocoaconf.com].

James is a old hand at Apple training, having gotten his chops teaching (WebObjects)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebObjects]. He also spent some time working with (DTS)[http://developer.apple.com], and (application)[http://apple.com/aperture] development as well.
