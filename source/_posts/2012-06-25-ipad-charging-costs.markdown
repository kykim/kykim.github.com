According to the Electric Power Research Institute [(ERPI)](http://www.epri.com/), it only costs $1.36 per year to charge your iPad [(source)](http://www.cultofmac.com/175195/your-new-ipad-costs-just-1-36-per-year-to-charge/).

Just to satisfy my curiousity, I ran my iPad charge through a [Kill-A-Watt 4400](http://www.p3international.com/products/special/p4400/p4400-ce.html) to see how much electricity I was "leaking" when not charging my iPad. The result: unmeasurable by the meter after a day.
