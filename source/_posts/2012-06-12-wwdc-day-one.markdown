I can't believe I forgot to take a picture of [Hair Force One](http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/06/11/280874-craig-federighi-apple-senior-vice-president-software-engineering-stand.jpg)

The rest of the day was a blur, and we ended it at a party hosted by our friends at [Crashlytics](http://www.crashlytics.com]
