My seven year old niece is learning how to do addition. One of the
drills they are doing is given a number, what other number do you need
to add up to 10. For example, if the teacher says "one", she needs to
reply "nine."

<!-- more -->

My niece is having a little trouble, so my sister says, "You give me a
number and I'll say the answer."

"One"
"Nine"

"Three"
"Seven"

"Five"
"Five"

"Nine"
"One"

"Mom, you sound like an app."
