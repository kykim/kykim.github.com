It's been a while since my last post. Without going into too much detail (which I may do later),
here's the quick recap:

<!-- more -->

* Stranded in Portland, OR, for a week due to [Sandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy)
* Post-Sandy, no heat, hot water, or power for 22 days (mostly due to my ~~landlord~~ slumlord).
* Cat diagnosed with [Feline Lymphoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma_in_animals#Lymphoma_in_cats). Dies day after Christmas.
* [Book](http://www.apress.com/9781430238072) get published.
* General [startup](http://www.apporchard.com/) craziness.

I hope to be more regular with the posts ongoing.
