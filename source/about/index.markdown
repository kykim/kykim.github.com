Hi there!

I'm a founder and partner of [AppOrchard LLC](http://www.apporchard.com/),
a iOS development shop in [New York City](http://www.nyc.gov). I
graduated from [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu) in 1991 with a B.S. in
Physics and Philosophy. I saw my first 
[NeXT Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube) while I was working 
at the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center](http://www.psc.edu), and haven't 
looked back. I've had a varied career, spanning 
[biotech](http://www.nrbsc.org), [government](http://www.fema.gov),
[finance](http://www.blackrock.com) and [techology](http://www.apple.com). 
My time at Apple was managing the 
[Apple Enterprise Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymoron) team in 
NYC. Right now, I live with my wife and 
[clowder](http://mannysullivan.blogspot.com) of cats in Alphabet City.
