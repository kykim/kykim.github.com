    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don't tell anyone where it is.</p>

<p>My friend Bruce is a member of the inner circle (cabal?). Everytime I come to San Francisco, I try to get him to take me there. My first time was at WWDC last year. Since then, I've gone three more times, and brought many of my colleagues with me. Now it's expected that I make arrangements for any trip to SF.</p>

<p>This time I brought my colleagues Simon and Sue.</p>
